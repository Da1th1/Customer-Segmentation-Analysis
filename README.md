# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed customer segmentation analysis using Python. The dataset consists of multiple features representing customer behaviors and characteristics, along with a target column indicating predefined customer segments.

## Files
- **customerTargeting.csv**: The primary dataset used for the analysis.
- **customer_targeting.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing all the Python code and visualizations.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `customer_targeting.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
3. Execute the cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Results
The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 58% on the test set. While it performed reasonably well for some classes, there's room for improvement.

## Future Work
- Explore other classification models to improve accuracy.
- Implement unsupervised clustering to identify potential new customer segments.
- Further feature engineering to enhance model performance.
